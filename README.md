# OEC Presentations

This repo is designed as a general study aide to prepare for the National Ski Patrol Outdoor Emergency Care Certification test. It is not affiliated with any official NSP publications and is not endorsed by NSP. The materials here cannot substitute for the OEC 5th Edition text and are not intended to act as a replacement to the text.

I have been a patroller for almost four seasons now and am a certified OEC Instructor in the midst of assisting in the teaching of an OEC certification course for my third year.
