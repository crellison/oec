      p.desc This set of presentations is designed as a general study aide to prepare for the National Ski Patrol Outdoor Emergency Care Certification test. While the presentations do not contain large chunks of text and should not replace flash-cards or other content-right study techniques, they may point you toward key topics and considerations from each chapter. It is not affiliated with any official NSP publications and is not endorsed by NSP. The materials here cannot substitute for the OEC 5th Edition text and are not intended to act as a replacement to the text.
      p.desc The presentations on this site are still under construction. While all are linked to presentations, many include only the chapter subheadings.
      p.desc Current Completed Chapters: 30 - 33
