## Anatomy and Physiology

^^^

## Hypoperfusion

^^^

## How does it present?  
- tachycardia <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->  
- tachypnea <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->  
- poor circulation in extremities <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->  


^^^

## The stages of shock  
- compensated <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->  
- decompensated <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->  
- irreversible <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

## Types of Shock

^^^

- Hypovolemic (not enough liquid)  
- Cardiogenic (problem with the pump)  
- Distributive (right amount of liquid, vessel too large)  
- Obstructive (something blocking the liquid)  


^^^

## Hypovolemic  
Where does the blood go?  
- external bleeds <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->  
- internal bleeds <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->  
- water loss from sweating <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

## Blood Loss Guide  
Class I | Class II | Class III | Class IV  
 --- | --- | --- | ---  
<0.75L | <1.5L | <2L | >2L  
mild | moderate | serious | life threatening  


^^^

## Hypovolemia in Context  
Femur fractures can cause 1.5L - 2L of blood loss  
Abdominal injuries can cause up to 6L of blood loss  


^^^

## Cardiogenic

^^^

## Distributive  
- septic  
- anaphylactic  
- neurogenic

You come across a biker lying beside a 12in diameter birch writhing in pain. Intially, he responds to your questions, but soon becomes less responsive. What may have happened?
