## Three required moves

- exam table to higher care transport  


^^^

## Urgent moves  
- done in situations that endanger the patroller or patient  
- only when rapid transport is required  
- typically a form of drag  


^^^

## Nonurgent moves  
- assists and carrys  


^^^

## Carrying patients is HARD

---

## Lifting the Patient

## Power grip and lift

^^^

## BEAN and BEAM lifts

## Body Positions  
- influenced by patient's distress and chief complaint  
- patient position is critical, as certain positions can cause conditions to worsen

## Scenarios

^^^

George Jedenoff, a Utah skiing legend, was shredding powder when he suddenly collapsed. How should you package him when you bring him for an examination?  


^^^

## Rothberg Position  
George's sudden collapse and age indicate a possible heart attack

You respond to a patient who had a yardsale and can't bear weight on their ankle. Which position is recommended to use in when transporting this patient?  


^^^

## Semi-fowler Position  
The patient had no major injury  


^^^

You respond to a skier who has crashed into a tree on a steep run and is point tender on their lumbar. How should they be positioned in transport?  


^^^

## Supine Position  
The lumbar pain indicates a possible spinal injury
